Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far I have a working game with a main character (the cat) that can move in 6 different directions. You can move the cat using either a keybaord or a controller. I have all the animations of the player completed as well.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I need to finish working on the aiming and shooting functionality of the game. I created a graphic for the cross hair, but still need to make it so you can aim and shoot. I still needs to add the enemies, game states, and scoring mechanic to the game.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have come across a problem with just about everything I have tried to do. Fortunately, there are a lot of useful resources and youtube tutorials on unity which have helped me figure out most of my problems. I have had to scrap one of my ideas where I tried to create a store where you can buy differnt blasters as you level up due to it being difficult and confusing.
