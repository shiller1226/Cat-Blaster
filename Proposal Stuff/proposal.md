# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Cat Dodger

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I am going to create a 2D "dodger" game using unity.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I am going to attempt to craete a 2d game using unity. In the game you will play as a cat and multiple bigger animals like bears and foxes will be moving over the screen. If you collide with anything you die. You control your character with WASD. Maybe some sort of fruits or coins will pop up that you can collect to increase score. The game is endless and can only be ended from the pause menu or when you are killed. If i can figure it out it could be fun to add a shooter aspect where the cat can pick up a weapon with a limited amount of ammo and use it to kill some of the enemies.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I can have a basic game created where you play as a character using WASD and you have to dodge bigger enemies in order to increase score.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Hopefully I will be able to make the basic game, then add more exciting elements such as the shooter aspect. Potentially could add different difficiultues as well.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

If I have the time and can figure it out, I would like to add a shop to the game where you can buy new skins and characters using the coins you collected from the game. I feel this would make the game more exciting and give players something to work towards.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn how to use unity. I have it downloaded on my computer, but have never attempted to make anything with it. I likely will have to do a lot of research and will probably be doing a lot of trial and error before the game works.
